### Hello!
I am a potato who does random things on GitHub to try and improve my own skills one at a time, and I mainly contribute and suggest ideas to other projects if I feel like it.

- üî≠ I am a triage for the [Fabulously Optimized](https://fabulously-optimized.github.io/discord) modpack,
- üçé I daily-drive macOS on my computer because I am satisified with it and don't need a ridiculous windows desktop experience,
- üìù Sometimes I like to write articles based on my opinions on topics from time-to-time whenever i feel like it.

<sub><sup><sup>stole this readme from [Kichura](https://github.com/Kichura) who also stole it from [kennytv](https://github.com/kennytv) and [triphora](https://github.com/triphora) just to make my own one out of it. thank you!</sup></sup></sup>
